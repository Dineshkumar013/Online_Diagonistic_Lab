# Project Title
The project is to bring an online diagonistic lab for people who required the result of the report without any delay. 
In most of the labs, the values of the test will be calculated quickly but assessing the required result takes hour of time. 
This is where our idea rose from. An Online Diagonistic lab that predicts the disease using some important feature. 
This provides us with the result in a fraction of second. Once entered the values, it predicts us the disease.
the model comprises of 6 models that helps us identify the disease.

## Datasets

The following are the disease
Kidney,heart,diabetes,liver,parkinson's,thyroid.

- KIDNEY MODEL:
This model helps us to identify any kind of kidney disfunction with the values of some characteristics in kidney. 

- HEART MODEL:
This model helps us to identify whether a person is affected by any heart disease or not in your heart.

- DIABETES MODEL:
This model helps us to classify a diabetic and a non-diabetic person.

- LIVER MODEL:
This model helps us to classify liver disease in your liver.

- BRAIN MODEL:
This model helps us to identify parkinson'disease in your brain.

- THYROID MODEL:
This model helps us to identify thyroid problems in your thyroid gland
