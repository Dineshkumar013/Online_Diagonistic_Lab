# Project Title
The project is to bring an online diagonistic lab for people who required the result of the report without any delay. 
In most of the labs, the values of the test will be calculated quickly but assessing the required result takes hour of time. 
This is where our idea rose from. An Online Diagonistic lab that predicts the disease using some important feature. 
This provides us with the result in a fraction of second. Once entered the values, it predicts us the disease.
the model comprises of 6 models that helps us identify the disease.
